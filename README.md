# Sample Dockerised Node.js project
With this you can get quickly up and running with Node.js development in a Dockerised environment

### Requirements
 1. Add `127.0.0.1 web` to your `/etc/hosts` file so your browser can resolve the hostname we are using in docker 
 2. Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

### Running it locally
- Run from the project root: `./run/locally.sh`
- Open `http://web:8080` in the browser
